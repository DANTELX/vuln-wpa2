      <h1>TERMINOLOGY</h1>
      <p>
        Before starting with the methodology you should learn some basic
        terminology so you know what we are talking about. :)
      </p>
      <h2>What is WPA2?</h2>
      <p>
        Wi-Fi Protected Access 2 (WPA 2) is one of many security protocols used
        to secure network connections. This protocol ensures that all your sent
        or received data is encrypted over the Advanced Encryption System (AES).
      </p>
      <h2>What is PSK?</h2>
      <p>
        Pre-Shared Key (PSK) is an encryption technique used along with the WPA2
        protocol to authenticate users in wireless networks. In this process, a
        key is shared to verify the client's identity. WPA2-PSK and WPA Personal
        refer to the same thing.
      </p>
      <h2>What is a network interface card (NIC)?</h2>
      <p>
        The network interface for short is the piece of hardware that gives us
        network capabilities. In Linux, the ethernet-based interfaces are
        commonly known as "eth" and the wireless interfaces are known as "wlan".
        For our purposes, we are gonna be using the wlan interface because we
        are dealing with wireless connections. Additionally, some wireless
        interfaces can monitor packages that will allow us to capture
        information by nearby wireless devices. Like a 4-way handshake.
      </p>
      <h2>What is a 4-way handshake?</h2>
      <p>
        In this context, a 4-way handshake is the first four authentication
        messages between the client and the Access Point (AP). This is very
        important to know because here is the weakness of the WPA2 Protocol.
        Because the encrypted password is shared when a 4-way handshake is
        exchanged, we can capture that handshake and crack the password with the
        help of a dictionary attack.
      </p>
      <h2>What is a deauth attack?</h2>
      <p>
        A deauth attack is a kind of denial of service attack (DoS) interrupting
        the communication between clients. The attacker can send
        de-authentication frames to an AP forcing a client to disconnect from
        the network.
      </p>
      <h1>METHODOLOGY</h1>
      <p>
        As you may know this website is focused on teaching you the basics of
        cracking a WPA2-PSK network. The process to achieve this goal can be
        divided into 4 easy steps:
      </p>
      <img src="img/diagram1.png" alt="diagram1" />
      <p>
        1. The first thing you should do is, configure the wireless interface
        since most of the following commands require a properly configured
        interface. Make sure that you set it so it can capture packages.
      </p>
      <p>
        2. Then, you have to get detailed information about your target network.
        The most important information for our goal is the MAC address and the
        channel number.
      </p>
      <p>
        3. Now that you have those two pieces of information, you can try to
        capture the handshake. You can wait a long time till you get a
        handshake, or you can perform a deauth attack to speed up the process.
      </p>
      <p>
        4. Finally, after getting that handshake you can proceed to the cracking
        step. For this, you will need two files: a wordlist and a .cap file
        containing the handshake.

        This website is intended to encourage research and practice rather than
        being a simple tutorial. The information provided should be enough to
        complete all the tasks, but if you have any questions you can always
        look it up on the internet. Good luck.
